        -  Model understanding and utilization of the custom language

**5. Recipe Pattern: Completing Incomplete Instructions**
    -  Providing partial steps and asking the model to fill in the gaps
    -  Utilizing ellipses (...) to indicate missing information
    -  Example 1: Trip planning with unspecified stops
        -  Combining the Meta Language and Recipe patterns
        -  Model understanding of ellipses as placeholders for missing steps
    -  Example 2: Trip planning with multiple unspecified stops
        -  Model interpretation of varying degrees of missing information

**6. Alternative Approaches Pattern: Brainstorming Solutions**
    -  Generating multiple approaches to problem-solving
    -  Leveraging the model's vast knowledge base for brainstorming
    -  Example 1: Writing prompts for identifying leap years

        -  Model comparison and contrast of the generated approaches
    -  Example 2: Automating email analysis and summarization
        -  Requesting alternative approaches and prompt generation for each
        -  Model generation of diverse and creative approaches
    -  Example 3: Evaluating generated prompts for email summarization
        -  Requesting prompts for evaluating prompt effectiveness
        -  Model generation of diverse evaluation approaches 


## Briefing Document: Mastering Prompt Engineering with Advanced Patterns

**Introduction:** This document summarizes advanced prompt engineering patterns that leverage large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for enhanced learning and problem-solving.
