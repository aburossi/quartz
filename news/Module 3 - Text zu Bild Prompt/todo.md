5. Repetition
	- Theorie: ✅
	- Aufträge: ❌
	- Evaluation: It would be beneficial to create a separate assignment focusing on the use of repetition in prompts.
	- Ideas: **Theory:** Explain how repetition can be used to emphasize specific elements or create a sense of rhythm in an image. Provide examples of prompts with repetition and analyze their effects. **Assignment:** Ask students to create prompts for a specific image using repetition. Have them experiment with different levels of repetition and analyze how it impacts the generated images.
6. Weighted Terms
	- Theorie: ✅
	- Aufträge: ❌
	- Evaluation:  It would be beneficial to create a separate assignment focusing on the use of weighted terms in prompts.
	- Ideas: **Theory:** Explain how weighted terms can be used to emphasize or de-emphasize certain aspects of an image. Provide examples of prompts with weighted terms and analyze their effects. **Assignment:** Ask students to create prompts for a specific image using weighted terms. Have them experiment with different weights and analyze how it impacts the generated images.
7. Fix Deformed Generations
	- Theorie: ✅
	- Aufträge: ❌
	- Evaluation: It would be beneficial to create a separate assignment focusing on fixing deformed generations in prompts.
	- Ideas: **Theory:** Discuss common deformities that can occur in AI-generated images and explain how to use negative prompts to mitigate them. Provide examples of negative prompts and their effects. **Assignment:** Provide students with examples of deformed images and ask them to create negative prompts to fix them. Have them experiment with different negative prompts and analyze their effectiveness.

# Conclusion
To enhance the educational content, the following steps are recommended:

**Repetition:**
- **Theory:** Add a section explaining the concept of repetition in prompts, its purpose, and how it can be used effectively. Include examples of prompts with repetition and analyze their impact on the generated images.
- **Assignment:** Create a new assignment titled "Repetition Power: Emphasizing Elements in Images". In this assignment, students will:
    - Choose a specific image or theme.
    - Create multiple prompts using repetition to emphasize different elements within the chosen image or theme.
    - Generate images using each prompt and compare the results.
    - Analyze how different levels of repetition affect the generated images.

**Weighted Terms:**
- **Theory:** Add a section explaining the concept of weighted terms in prompts, their purpose, and how to use them effectively. Include examples of prompts with weighted terms and analyze their impact on the generated images.
- **Assignment:** Create a new assignment titled "Weighted Words: Controlling Image Focus". In this assignment, students will:
    - Choose a specific image or theme.
    - Create multiple prompts using weighted terms to emphasize or de-emphasize different aspects of the chosen image or theme.
    - Generate images using each prompt and compare the results.
    - Analyze how different weights affect the generated images.

**Fix Deformed Generations:**
- **Theory:** Add a section discussing common deformities in AI-generated images, such as distorted body parts or unnatural proportions. Explain how to use negative prompts to mitigate these issues. Provide examples of negative prompts and their effects.
- **Assignment:** Create a new assignment titled "Deformity Detective: Using Negative Prompts". In this assignment, students will:
    - Be provided with examples of deformed images.
    - Analyze the deformities and identify the elements that need correction.
    - Create negative prompts to address the identified deformities.
    - Generate images using the negative prompts and compare the results.
    - Analyze the effectiveness of the negative prompts in fixing the deformities.

By implementing these additions, the educational content will comprehensively cover all the subtopics of the textbook chapter, providing students with a deeper understanding of text-to-image prompting techniques.
