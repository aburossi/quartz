3. **Time Aspect of Prompts:**
    - Theorie: ✅
    - Aufträge: ❌
    - Evaluation: It would be beneficial to create a dedicated assignment to illustrate how prompts can have a time aspect, influencing future interactions with the LLM.
    - Ideas: 
        - **Theory:**  Expand on the concept of "time prompts" and provide more explicit examples of how they work. Explain how LLMs maintain context over multiple interactions. 
        - **Assignment:** Create an exercise where students give ChatGPT a prompt that instructs it to perform a specific action "from now on." For example, "From now on, whenever I ask you about a city, tell me its population and its main industries." Then have students ask follow-up questions about different cities and observe how ChatGPT remembers and applies the initial instruction.
4. **Prompt as a Reminder/Cue:**
    - Theorie: ✅
    - Aufträge: ❌
    - Evaluation: A practical assignment is needed to demonstrate how prompts can serve as reminders or cues for LLMs, influencing their responses based on previous interactions.
    - Ideas:
        - **Theory:**  Further elaborate on how prompts can be used to provide context or remind the LLM of previous instructions, influencing its current output.
        - **Assignment:**  Design an exercise where students engage in a multi-turn conversation with ChatGPT. They could start by providing some information about a topic (e.g., "I am writing a story about a detective in London.") and then use prompts to guide ChatGPT in generating relevant story elements, reminding it of the initial context.  
5. **Prompt as User Input Elicitation:**
    - Theorie: ✅
    - Aufträge: ❌
    - Evaluation:  A practical assignment is necessary to showcase how LLMs can be prompted to elicit specific information from the user. 
    - Ideas:
        - **Theory:** Include examples of how LLMs can be prompted to ask questions, guiding the user to provide specific information.
        - **Assignment:**  Create an exercise where students design a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to act as a chatbot collecting information for a specific purpose (e.g., ordering food, booking a flight, gathering feedback). Students should focus on crafting prompts that elicit the necessary details from the user in a clear and conversational manner. 
6. **Formatting Output (CSV Example):**
    - Theorie: ❌
    - Aufträge: ❌
    - Evaluation: While the concept of programming with prompts is touched upon, the specific example of formatting output as CSV is not explicitly covered in either theory or assignments. It would be beneficial to add this as it's a practical application of using prompts to structure output.
    - Ideas:
        - **Theory:** Introduce the concept of using prompts to control the format of the output. Explain how LLMs can be instructed to generate data in structured formats like CSV.
        - **Assignment:**  Create an assignment where students provide ChatGPT with information (e.g., a list of names and ages) and then use a prompt to instruct it to format the data as a CSV list.

# Conclusion
To enhance the educational content and ensure it comprehensively covers the textbook chapter, the following steps are recommended:

- **Time Aspect of Prompts:**
    1. Expand the theoretical section on "time prompts" with clearer explanations and more diverse examples.
    2. Create a new assignment: "Time-Based Prompting."
        - Instruct students to give ChatGPT a prompt with a "from now on" instruction.
        - Have students test the prompt with follow-up questions to observe how the LLM remembers and applies the initial instruction.
- **Prompt as a Reminder/Cue:**
    1. Elaborate on the theory section to emphasize how prompts can provide context and remind the LLM of previous instructions.
    2. Create a new assignment: "Contextual Prompting for Storytelling."
        - Guide students to provide an initial context to ChatGPT (e.g., a story setting).
        - Have students use prompts to generate story elements, reminding the LLM of the established context.
- **Prompt as User Input Elicitation:**
    1. Add examples to the theory section showing how LLMs can be prompted to ask questions and elicit user input.
    2. Create a new assignment: "Chatbot Design with Prompts."
        - Task students with designing prompts that instruct ChatGPT to act as a chatbot for a specific purpose.
        - Focus on prompts that effectively gather necessary details from the user in a conversational manner.
- **Formatting Output (CSV Example):**
    1. Introduce a new theory section on using prompts to control output format, including structured formats like CSV.
    2. Create a new assignment: "Data Formatting with Prompts."
        - Provide students with data and instruct them to use prompts to format it as a CSV list.
