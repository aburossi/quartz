	- Evaluation: It is necessary to create new assignments to cover this subtopic.
	- Ideas: 
		- Theory: Provide a detailed explanation of each building block, focusing on its importance and how it influences the AI's response. Use visual aids like diagrams or tables to illustrate the concepts. 
		- Assignments:
			- Basic: Give students a simple prompt and ask them to identify the four building blocks. Then, have them improve the prompt by adding or refining each block.
			- Intermediate:  Provide students with a complex task (e.g., writing a short story with specific character traits, setting, and plot points). Guide them to break down the task and craft a prompt with clear instructions, context, input data, and output indicators for each element.

	- Evaluation: Expand on existing assignments to highlight these benefits in practical scenarios.
	- Ideas: 
		- Theory: No changes needed.
		- Assignments:
			- Basic: When students are comparing their prompts and analyzing ChatGPT's responses, add questions that prompt them to reflect on how their prompt refinements led to improvements in the AI's output.  
			- Intermediate:  In the assignment where students work on complex tasks, emphasize the iterative process. Have them document their prompt refinements and the corresponding changes in ChatGPT's output. This will demonstrate the benefits of prompt engineering for optimizing model performance and achieving desired results.
